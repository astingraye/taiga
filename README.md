# taiga
## A selfhosted ollama based media organiser

## How it works
In the backend, taiga takes a base64 encoded image and uses a vision capable ollama model (and a lot of badly written system prompts) to analyse it into 3 values
- Title
- Description
- Tags (Array)

## Release?
Most likely. It all depends on the motivation I have to clean up the code enough to be public ðŸ˜­ (and add some quality of life features)
